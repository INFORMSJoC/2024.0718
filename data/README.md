# Data for replication

Here is the data needed for replicating the experiments. The file format can be found in the Instance_Files_Format.txt file. 

The capital budgeting instances are from the paper [Decomposition-Based Approaches for a Class of Two-Stage Robust Binary Optimization Problems](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2021.1061) by A.N. Arslan and B. Detienne, which the authors have kindly made available online [here](https://github.com/borisdetienne/RobustDecomposition). We first downloaded these instances in 2021.
