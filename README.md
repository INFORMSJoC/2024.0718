## Description

Here you can find the data (data folder), code (src folder) and main results (results folder) from the numerical experiments found in our paper. The data corresponds to the particular model parameterizations of each adaptive robust problem that we considered. The code is written in Python, and covers the process of building a decision diagram, as well as formulating and solving the corresponding network flow models using Gurobi. Finally, the results include the solution times, primal and dual bounds generated by our models. Additional details can be found in the README files within each folder.
