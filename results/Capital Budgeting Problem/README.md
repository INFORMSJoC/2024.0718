## Additional documentation

Results for the capital budgeting instances. Each folder is associated with an instance size (N = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50). Each folder has up to 4 types of files, described below:

DDrel_solvetime_statsQ.csv contains a summary of the solution times of all exact and approximate network flow models.

Objval_exact_stats.csv contains the objective value of the exact network flow model. There is no such file for N = 50, as the decision diagrams were too large to solve (see paper).

Objval_relQX_stats.csv contains the objective value of the approximate network flow model. X represents the value of Q during the merging process used to construct the diagram (see paper).

real_objval_relX_stats.csv contains the real objective value of the first-stage solution generated by the approximate network flow model. 

With these files, we can calculate the various optimality gaps discussed in the paper.
